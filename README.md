## Overview

With Creating a data visualization that gives your users the ability to explore or understand the MoMA collection dataset of artwork and artists. 

- ðŸ“Š Research, the goal of the research and sketch the context of diversity in modern art institutions and the MoMa in particular.

-  Data insights, I show the results from the analysis illustrated with colorful graphs and accompanied by a conclusion and discussions.

_Please note that I don't claim to have all the answers here â€” just sharing my thoughts based on the MoMA collection data(as of May 2024). I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas, too! The data on diversity is limited - not counting dual or more natinalities, and it's not perfect. I am not accusing anyone but I think results are a good starting point for discussion. but it's a great place to start a conversation.  I'm still learning about data processing, so there may be a few flaws here and there and I'll continue to work on understanding the data better._
